    "In this tutorial, we will perform clustering of ligand cavity. This tutorial can be used as a giude **to perform protein channel shape clustering** to analyse different shapes of channel during the simulations. The protein considered in this tutorial has ligand cavity burried deep inside the protein and cavity is almost linear.\n",

    "7. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Preparation of reference structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference structure need to be prepared where cavity/channel axis align with one of the principal axis. For protein channel, it might be already done as channel-axis is mostly aligned along z-axis. In this case, I have already aligned the ligand-cavity axis along the Y-axis and it is provided as `inputs/ref_cavity.pdb`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Generate a new trajectory superimposed on reference structure\n",
    "\n",
    "`gmx_clusterByFeatures hole` has a functionality to superimpose the conformation for consistent calculation of cavity/channel radius along the given vector However, during clustering, the output central structures and cluster trajectory will be not superimposed and therefore, it is good to superimpose whole trajectory on reference structure so that cluster's central structures orientations will be same as of reference structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `gmx trjconv` to create a new superimposed trajectory with reference structre as follows.\n"
