gmx_clusterByFeatures
=====================
It can be used to cluster the conformations of a molecule in a molecular dynamics
trajectory using collection of features. The features could be any quantity as a
function of time such as Projections of eigenvector from PCA or dihedral-PCA,
distances, angles, channel radius etc.

**See details at:** `gmx_clusterByFeatures homepage <https://gmx-clusterbyfeatures.readthedocs.io>`_

.. note:: It is developed for **GROMACS MD trajectory.** However, it can be used with
  any other trajectory format after converting it to GROMACS format trajectory.

Installation on Linux and MacOS
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip3 install gmx-clusterByFeatures

No dependency on GROMACS. Install and use it.

For more details, visit `download and installation <https://gmx-clusterbyfeatures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ section.

Development Setup for conda
---------------------------
Following steps are for development setup. However, these steps can be used for installation using conda

  # Clone the repository and setup development environment
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/rjdkmr/gmx_clusterByFeatures.git
  cd gmx_clusterByFeatures
  conda env create -y --prefix ./venv --file environment.yaml # Create development conda environment
  conda activate ./venv # Activate the environment
  bash -i scripts/build_dev_setup_conda.sh # all build and setup steps are in this script
